# WeatherApp
This is my first step towards App development with React Native. Followed the tutorial of free code camp on YouTube : https://youtu.be/obH0Po_RdWk  and the repository https://github.com/Em01/weather-app-demo and tried to implement some new features.

### New features :
1. A search button that allows users to get weather information of any city from OpenWeatherMap API using city name. For that, first I used the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API call to extract the coordinates of the city and then the 5 day / 3 hour forecast API call to extract weather information based on the coordinates.
2. Different background images for different weathers.
3. When the List Items of the Upcoming Weather Tab is clicked, the background image changes as per the weather indicated in that item.
